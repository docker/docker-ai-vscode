# Release Notes

## vscode-docker-1.29.5-alpha.vsix

### What is this project?

We are not forking the current [vscode docker extension](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docker). 

This is intended to be a contribution back to the original extension.  
We are just providing this project to get early feedback on that contribution.  
The proposed pull request branch is [here](https://github.com/docker/vscode-upstream-temp/commits/cm/docker-stuff-2).

Initially, there are two features added to the Dockerfile language service.

1.  Integration of Scout recommendations to the Dockerfile language service.
2.  Integration of the new support for Docker's new official Dockerfile linting support.

### How to get started

See [installation instructions](lsp/README.md) for details on how to try out this update.
