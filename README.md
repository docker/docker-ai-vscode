# Docker-VSCode
A collection of experimental Docker extensions

## What is this project?

We are not forking the current [vscode docker extension](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docker). 

This is intended to be a contribution back to the original extension.  
We are just providing this project to get early feedback on that contribution.  

The proposed pull request branch is [here](https://github.com/docker/vscode-upstream-temp/commits/cm/docker-stuff-2).

Initially, there are two features added to the Dockerfile language service.

1.  Integration of Scout recommendations to the Dockerfile language service.
2.  Integration of the new support for Docker's new official Dockerfile linting support.

## Getting started

See the complete [installation instructions](./lsp) for adding this version of the 
Docker extension to VSCode.
